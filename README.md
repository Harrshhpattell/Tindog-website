I created Tindog, a website that is inspired by Tinder, but for dogs. This website was created by following the Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu.
## Context:
Tindog is a platform designed to help dog owners find playmates for their furry friends. It's perfect for those who want to socialize their dogs, and also for those who want to meet other dog owners in their area. With Tindog, users can create a profile for their dogs, browse through other dogs in their area, and connect with other dog owners to set up playdates.
## Technologies:
To create Tindog, I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end.
